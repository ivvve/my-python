"""
In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Example:

make_negative(1);  # return -1
make_negative(-5); # return -5
make_negative(0);  # return 0
Notes:

The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

"""
Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

For example:

Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.
